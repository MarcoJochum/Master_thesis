# Master Thesis: Bayesian Dynamics Aware SurrogaTe for Kinetic Monte Carlo Simulation



Work in progress...

# Basic outline:

- use VAE to encode dynamics from kMC simulation of a Solid State Electrolyte
- propagate the dynamics in the latent space using LSTM, LNN or Transformer
- Decode thh full representation at a future timepoint to avoid time intenisve kMC simulations
